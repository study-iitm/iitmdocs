Companies such as Verizon India, L&T Technology Services, L&T Thales Technology Services Private Limited, Dun & Bradstreet, Natesan, Synchrocones, Walmart, Renault-Nissan, Ram Shriram Foundation, Tata AIA, Tiger Analytics, Cargill Business Services, Cochin Shipyard and RR Donnelley have generously contributed to institute merit-cum-means scholarships to remove financial blocks from the path of economically disadvantaged students thirsting to learn from the best. More than 1700 students with family income less than 5LPA are currently being supported in their journey of earning Diplomas and the BS degree from IIT Madras. We profoundly thank our donors for their generous support.

We are very glad to share that as the implementing institute, the IIT Madras BS Degree Program has been recognized with:

##### “Professionals Speak” on current industry and technology trends

Employees of Industry partners who have more than 10+ years of experience in relevant fields have
delivered multiple
talks on topics related to application development, programming and data science.
This gives students in the course a valuable opportunity to interact with experienced professionals
and get a perspective on the latest technological trends in top companies. More than 50 sessions
have been delivered so far by professionals from companies such as IBM, CapGemini, Infosys, etc. The
links to the expert sessions from the industry are given in this [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vS-QIZe9CeHds80FD_yFAD-c85-9xlF7FxVOSiJVd_cpU647tyX52OA31shNMeshDP9ALH0Hm_rmKk2/pubhtml?gid=23597324&single=true&urp=gmail_link).

statistics, ability to draw Inferences from
the data using statistical and machine learning techniques, using machine learning algorithms to
solve practical problems using libraries like scikit-learn and tensorflow, know-how to use
