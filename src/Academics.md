Online Courses & Assignments

Duration of each course: 12 weeks - Each week comprising 2-3 hrs of videos, practice questions, text
transcripts and online graded assignment(s).

![](assets/img/academics/Academics_icon-05.svg)

Quizzes and Exams

In-person invigilated quizzes and exams as per the grading pattern defined for each course.

Term Structure

Every **year is divided into three terms**  of four months each -
*January Term, May Term and September Term.*

Each term of four months has 12 weeks of coursework (video lectures and assignments), 2 in-person invigilated
Quizzes and End Term Exams. Depending on the course, assessments may include programming exams, mini projects,
vivas, take home assignments, etc.

![](assets/img/academics/course_structure_web.png)

Course Registrations

In each term, a learner may register for upto 4 courses depending on their CCC (Credit Clearing Capability).

A learner’s CCC in the Foundation Level is calculated based on their performance in the Qualifier Exam or the
previous term’s End Term Exams. The CCC in the Diploma Level and thereafter is 4.

All 8 courses in Foundation Level need to be successfully completed before registering for any Diploma Level course.
Similarly, all Diploma Level courses & projects need to be successfully completed before registering for any Degree
Level course.

Assessments

There are 3 types of assessments for each course:  
 
Weekly Assignments which are online  
  monthly
in-person Quizzes  
  in-person End Term Exam
  
View More Details

In addition, assessments may include programming exams, mini projects, vivas, take home assignments, etc.

Assessment

There are 3 types of assessments for each course - online weekly assignments, monthly in-person
invigilated quizzes and an in-person invigilated end term exam.

1. Online Assignments

A 12 week course will have one or more weekly assignments to be submitted online within the
due date specified.

The average score of the best 5 out of the first 9 weekly assignments given during the
course run should be >= 40/100 to be eligible to write the final exam and get the hall
ticket for the same. (Score in any unattempted assignment will be counted as 0).

The scores obtained in these will be counted towards the Total Course Score T and
will determine the eligibility to write the End Term Exam.

2. Two Invigilated Quizzes

Two quizzes will be conducted at the end of Weeks 4 and 8 based on the content of Weeks 1-4 and 1-8
respectively.

Each quiz will be a single session exam with 4 hrs to attempt 4 subjects, 3 hrs to attempt 3
subjects and 2 hrs to attempt 2 or 1 subject.

The score of a quiz not attempted will be taken as 0. No make-up quiz will be provided.

It is mandatory to attend at least one of the 2 quizzes. Else, the learner will not be
eligible to write the final exam.

The Qualifier Exam Score will be counted as Quiz 1 score for the courses registered in the
Foundation level only in the subsequent term of the Qualifier Exam.

3. End Term Exam

At the end of a term, there will be an End Term Exam of 1.5 hours duration for each course.
(This will ensure exams can be conducted only on Sundays and exams for 4 courses completed
in 2 sessions of 3 hrs each throughout the program.)

Eligibility to write the End Term Exam: Average weekly graded online assignment score >=
40/100 AND learner has appeared for at least one out of the two invigilated quizzes.

If the above eligibility is not satisfied, the learner will not be allowed to write the End
Term Exam and will have to repeat the full course.

The score obtained in the End Term Exam accounts for 50% of the Total Course Score T -
called End Term Score (E).

Pass criteria for each course

Total Course Score (T) = Average Quiz Score Q (out of 50) + End Term Score E (out of 50)

A candidate is deemed to have passed a course IF Total Course Score (T) >= 50/100.   
This
criteria is the same for all learners in the course.

The IITM BS program strives to secure scholarships from CSR and Alumni donations for its students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds to cover the full program fees.

As intermittent support till such donations are secured, IIT Madras covers part of the fees for the BS program students from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.

The fraction of IIT Madras' fee support depends on the learner's category and family income and is given below:

|  | Family Income > 5 LPA | | Family Income > 1 LPA and <= 5 LPA | | Family Income <= 1 LPA | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fee Support  from IIT Madras | Docs Required | Fee Support  from IIT Madras | Docs Required | Fee Support  from IIT Madras | Docs Required |
| General | N/A | NIL | 50% | EWS + Family Income | 75% | EWS + Family Income |
| OBC | N/A | NIL | 50% | OBC-NCL + Family Income | 75% | OBC-NCL + Family Income |
| SC / ST | 50% | SC / ST | 50% | SC / ST | 75% | SC / ST + Family Income |
| PwD | 50% | PwD | 50% | PwD | 75% | PwD + EWS / OBC-NCL + Family Income |
| SC / ST + PwD | 75% | SC / ST + PwD | 75% | SC / ST + PwD | 75% | SC / ST + PwD |

\*IITM contribution does not apply to International students.

The term family income for the purpose of availing IITM fee support includes the income of the candidate, the income of
his/her parents and spouse, also the income of his/her siblings and children below the age of 18 years.  
*Family income certificate is not required while applying for the Degree program, but will be required to avail IITM
fee support when joining the program.*

[*Download EWS Certificate format*](assets/pdf/Format_EWS.pdf)



*Note: If a learner does not pass a course in the term they registered for, they will need to repeat the entire
course in a later term with re-payment of full course fee. If a learner completed all course requirements, but couldn't
attend the end term exam alone, they can choose to repeat just the end term exam in the next term with the payment
of an end term exam fee (₹1000 for foundation level courses; ₹2000 for diploma / degree level courses).*
