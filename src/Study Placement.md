### Student Placement Process

The placement process for IIT Madras study students involves several key steps aimed at facilitating successful career placements. These steps include registering on the portal to initiate the placement process, remitting the fee for placement assistance to access comprehensive support services, and undergoing pre-placement training prescribed by the IIT Madras Study Placement Cell. However, students who have previously completed similar training may proceed directly to pre-placement task assessments. Only those who meet the minimum cut-off score in these assessments can proceed to explore job opportunities, submit applications, and track their application statuses through the portal. The process also involves understanding the selection process outlined by recruiters and deliberating on job offers received. By following these steps, students can navigate the placement process effectively and enhance their chances of securing suitable employment opportunities.
