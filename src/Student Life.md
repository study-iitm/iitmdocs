STUDENT HOUSES & SOCIETIES

Get empowered, be part of our

virtual campus, build real communities

and become future leaders.

Here in IITM BS degree, students, faculty and staff work together
to support students make the most of their opportunities.

#### Student Houses

![](assets/img/studentlife/HouseStructure-2.svg)

All students in the programme will be divided into
12 houses named after the forests in India.

##### Your house is where you seek, share, support and study together and do what you love through clubs and activities.

We invite the Student community to feel at home in their
forest houses of
Bandipur, Corbett, Gir, Kanha, Kaziranga, Nallamala,
Namdapha, Nilgiri, Pichavaram, Saranda, Sundarbans and
Wayanad.

Each house accommodates nearly 30 groups of 20 students each
where the group members are from the same city or neighbouring
cities and house members are from across the country.

##### Upper House Council & Elections

Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries of all 12 houses constitute
the Upper House Council that governs all houses.

The Student Elections Committee constituted by Student Affairs conducts
free and fair elections every August, where all the house members elect their
Secretary and Deputy Secretary for a tenure of one year. The Secretary of the
house in turn conducts elections for all groups, where all group members
elect their Group leaders. The Secretaries and Group leaders are below 25
years of age.
