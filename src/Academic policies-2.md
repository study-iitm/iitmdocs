## 13\. Design Thinking for Data-Driven App Development

Academic policies

1\. In each programming assignment, be it any course or any OPPE,  taking help from LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini) partially or completely is considered plagiarism.

2\. Unless explicitly permitted, do not use LLMs. Using LLMs is considered a violation of honour code.

3\. Students can discuss and learn from each other but the assignments are expected to be done individually based on their understanding.

Quiz 1 : No                         Quiz 2: August 03 2025                             End term:  August 31 2025

Above to be attended in person at designated centres.

Eligibility to write the final exam: Average of the best 5 out of 7 weekly assignment scores >= 40/100

Eligibility to obtain the final course grade: Attending the term-end exam AND submitting the final project, with getting more than 60/100 in the project

The calculation of final course score for eligible students is as follows:

GAA = Average score in First 10 weekly graded assignments (Subjective & Objective)

Qz2 = score in Quiz II (0, if not attempted)

GP1, GP2, GP3 = scores in the group project;

F = score in final exam, based on weeks 1-12 (Subjective  & Objective)

T = 0.1\*GAA + 0.1\*GP1 + 0.1\*GP2 + 0.2\*GP3 + 0.2Qz2 + 0.3\*F

Note: This course requires students to have access to a credit card/debit card in order to activate the $300 (~₹25,000) one-time free trial credit available on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Expected Credit Usage:

The total credit usage throughout the course is estimated to be around ₹12,000, assuming resources are used optimally. This means the free credits provided by GCP should be sufficient for most students.
