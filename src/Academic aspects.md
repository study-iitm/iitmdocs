### 15.3 Evaluation and grading of courses in every term

Each course has 3 types of assessments - online weekly assignments, monthly in-person proctored quizzes and an in-person end term exam.

**Online assignments:**

- A 12 week course will have one or more weekly assignments to be submitted online within the due date specified.
- The average score of the best 5 out of the first 7 weekly assignments given during the course run should be >= 40/100 to be eligible to write the final exam and get the hall ticket for the same.
- This will also contribute to the Final score and course grade. (Score in any unattempted assignment will be counted as 0).
- May change from course to course - check the grading document for actual details

**2 proctored Quizzes - to be attempted in person in the city chosen**

- Two quizzes will be conducted at the end of Weeks 4 and 8 based on the content of Weeks 1-4 and 1-8 respectively.
- Will be a single session exam with 4 hrs to attempt 4 subjects, 3 hrs to attempt 3 subjects and 2 hrs to attempt 2 or 1 subject.
- The Qualifier score will be counted as Quiz 1 score for the courses registered in the Foundation level only in the subsequent term of the qualifier exam, unless the candidate attempts Quiz 1 again in which case the better of the 2 scores will be used for calculations.
- The score of a quiz not attempted will be taken as 0. No make-up quiz will be provided.
- At least one of the 2 quizzes has to be mandatorily attended by the candidate else he/she will not be eligible to write the final exam. (check grading document for changes)

**Final end term exam at the end of the course**

- At the end of a term, there will be an end term exam of 1.5 hours duration for each course. (This will ensure exams can be conducted only on Sundays and exams for 4 courses completed in 2 sessions of 3 hrs each throughout the program.)
- Eligibility to write the End sem exam: Pls check the grading document for details.
- The final exam score accounts for 50% of the Total Course Score T - called End Semester Score (E)

### 15.6 Pass criteria for each course

Total Course Score (T) will be the sum of all assessment components in every course as defined in the Grading document of that term.

**For improvement**  
A learner can repeat a course for improvement in grades any number of times. The fee for repeating the course for improvement will be twice the regular course fee and the learner will have to submit all the weekly assignments, appear for the quizzes and final exams. The highest score amongst all attempts for a course will be used for calculating the CGPA.  

**If learner was not eligible to attempt the end term exam (grade=WA/WQ) or if the learner did not pass the course (Grade = U)**  
If average assignment score < 40/100 or no quiz attended or T<40/100, the learner has to repeat the entire course. This includes submission of assignments and redoing all the subsequent quizzes and the end term exam. Fees for repeating the course is the same as the course fees.  

**If the learner was absent for the final exam alone (grade = I):**  
The learner has 2 options:  
- **Reappear for the final term exam - Makeup exam:** They can attend only the end term exam whenever it is conducted in the subsequent term.  
  - The fee to repeat an end term exam will be Rs.1000 for each course of the foundational level and Rs. 2000 for each course of the diploma / degree levels.  
  - If the learner reattempts the course in the immediate next term, then the average Quiz Score Q will be carried over and the learner does not have to resubmit the quizzes or the assignments.  
  - If the learner wishes to skip the immediate next term and attempt the course in subsequent terms, then the entire course will have to be repeated including the weekly assignments and quizzes.  
  - A learner can reappear for the makeup exam  only once. If the learner misses the makeup exam, then the learner has to repeat the entire course in the term thereafter, by paying the full course fees and repeating all assignments, invigilated quizzes and the end term exam.  

- **Repeat the entire course:** They can choose to repeat the entire course.  
  - The fee to repeat the course will be the same as the regular course fees.

- Each level must be completed within 36 months (3 years / 9 terms).  
- The entire programme must be completed within 96 months (8 years / 24 terms).

- Maximum number of new + repeat full course (if failed/absent if reqd/improvement) <= CCC

### 15.7.2 Repeating a Course - WA, WQ, U or I grade  
Applicable for courses with WA, WQ, U or I grade.  

You can choose to repeat courses in a single term or across multiple terms. You can also register for new courses in the term. The total number of courses must be within the CCC limit. Learners with an Incomplete (I) grade in a course can take a Make Up Exam instead of repeating the course.  

### 15.7.3 Repeating a Course for Improvement

You can choose to repeat courses to improve the grade in the course. The highest grade will be recorded in the transcript. The total number of courses must be within the CCC limit. Course fee Repeat for Improvement courses will be double the normal fee. Improvement courses can be registered at any level. Eg: Foundation course improvement can be registered at diploma level.  

**Note:** It is recommended that learners try and progress with new courses instead of repeating courses for improvement, unless a learner deems it absolutely necessary or needs to improve their learning of a course. All course material of completed courses are available to the learner throughout the course.  

### 15.7.4 Make Up Exams  
Applicable for courses with I grade.  

You can choose to take a Makeup Exam for a course with Incomplete (I) grade. Learners will only be required to reappear for the Final Exam for that course.

If you have already registered for 4 courses, you do not have any more final exam slots available.  

**Note:** The grading pattern for make-up exams will be as follows: the pattern used will be as per the formula used in the term the course work was done and not as per the term the makeup exam was taken.
